                <p>I thought I had heard that we didn’t have to turn in a Weekly Reflection for week 7, that’s why I had
                    no submissions. I just saw in my notifications that mine was over due. Sorry about that. Here are
                    some screenshots of the games I created.</p>

                <p>Here is a screenshot of my Flyer Game from Lesson 24. This one was fun. I took away the borders so
                    that the player could wrap around the screen and come out on the other side opposite where he went
                    off.</p>

                <div class="img"><img style="width: 50%" src="/images/lv1/lv1-week7-1.png"
                        alt="Lesson 24: Flyer Game screenshot"></div>

                <p>This is from Lesson 26. This one wasn’t as fun as the last game to play but was fun to code.</p>
