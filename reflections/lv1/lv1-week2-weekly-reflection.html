                <p>This week we started off with where we left off last week’s CSS. As I mentioned in the feedback page
                    on lesson 13-8 I believe, the flexbox children properties was what gave me the most pause. I took
                    Robert’s advice and went through the flexbox froggy game. How genius is that?\! After going through
                    that game I feel I have a much better grasp on the flexbox children than before.</p>

                <p class="spacer">I ended up doing Angelina’s comic book site. I know Robert said it wasn’t going to be
                    as difficult as the other two but it was a nice project to work on. Talk about bringing back some
                    memories from a LONG time ago. But here are a couple of screenshots of the finished product.</p>
